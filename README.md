# Street Artist - project02 by Vlatko Jakimoski

## About

For this project i had to build a two page website Barinster Lasbs where all projects of Brainster students will be presented. Brainster Labs serves as a showcase of all that i have learned in the first part of the course, CSS and HTML but also to test my knowlege of JavaScript.
For compleating this project i used Html, SCSS and JavaScript which was a little chalenging for me beacuse this was the first time i used JS on a project and i wanted to complete all tasks that where given and also build the project as best as i can.
